# HTML Email Showcase

This repository features a collection of hand-coded HTML emails I designed and developed. These were built a few years ago and reflect a strong understanding of responsive design, inline styling, and email client compatibility.

> ðŸ’» Coded manually with classic tools â€” likely using:
> - MJML (Mailjet Markup Language) - Framework
> - Sublime Text  
> - Email on Acid (for testing)  
> - Chrome DevTools  
> - GitHub & Netlify for deployment
